  <h1 class="headercenter">General Posting Guidelines</h1>
  <h2 class="headercenter">Please read the guidelines outlined below and keep them in mind while posting with your script. Not following the guidlines below and/or abusing your script may result in getting banned from certain subreddits and/or the deletion of your account. I will not be liable for such outcomes if the below guidelines are not followed.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>When saving photos and videos onto your computer don’t include any white spaces in the image/video file names (e.g. make sure you save your photo as &nbsp;<code>my_gorgeous_self.jpg</code>&nbsp; rather than &nbsp;<code>my gorgeous self.jpg</code>). If your file names have white spaces in them your script will not be able to post them.</li>
      <li>If you chose any subs that require you to verify yourself on your intake form, please do so manually before posting with your script.</li>
      <li>Don’t mention your OnlyFans or Fansly anywhere in your posts. These get flagged as spam in most subs and get less engagement in general.</li>
      <li>Don’t post captions that ask for karma or imply a request for karma. Sub mods hate this and doing so may get you banned from that sub.</li>
      <li>Don't use your script more than once per day. Using your script to post multiple times per day for prolonged periods of time will likely result in your account getting flagged as spam and deleted. You can still post photos and videos manually to a few other subs on the same days you post with your script -- just don't abuse the script and use it to post an inappropriate amount of times. Posting a moderate amount of content on a daily basis will get you more engagement anyway.  </li>
    </ol>

  <h1 class="headercenter">How to Post Pictures & Videos Using Your OnlyPost Script</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a new terminal window.</li>
      <li>Type <code>post</code> and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Type <code>picture</code> and hit enter to post a picture or type <code>video</code> and hit enter to post a video.</li>
      <li>Type the caption for your photo or video and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Open Finder (the white and blue smiley face in your dock) and drag and drop whatever photo or video you want to post onto the terminal.</li>
      <li>Dragging and dropping an image or video from your finder will deselect the terminal window. Click on the terminal window so you can continue.</li>
      <li>Hit enter.</li>
      <li>A list of genres will be presented to you. Determine what genre the content you're about to post falls under, type it into the terminal, and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Leave the terminal open until the script is done executing. When the script is done executing a message that says <code> All done! You can now close the terminal window :) </code> will be printed out onto the terminal.</li>
      <li>That's it! Close the terminal window and repeat the next time you want to post a photo or video.</li>
    </ol>
